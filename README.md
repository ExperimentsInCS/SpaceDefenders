# SpaceDefenders
A classic 1980s-style arcade game, developed in Python with PyGame

## Objective

Learn the basics of PyGame, while practicing with functions.

_**Note:** This tutorial ignores classes, which results in some pretty awful code.  A future tutorial will show you how to implement a game with classes, which results in much cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain code._
